### 2️⃣ AI Study Buddy Website — Real-Time AI Study Assistant (Local LLM)

**Type:** Academic / Personal Project  
**Brief:** Built a web-based **AI-powered study assistant** that uses a **local LLM** to support interactive question answering, explanations, and learning workflows.

**What I did:**
- Designed and implemented a **modular backend architecture** to integrate a **local LLM** (e.g., Ollama / GPT4All / Mistral-style) for real-time responses
- Built REST endpoints for:
  - Question answering  
  - Context-based suggestions  
  - Session-based conversations  
- Implemented **frontend UI** to allow students to:
  - Ask questions in natural language  
  - Receive explanations, summaries, and clarifications  
  - Interact with the assistant in a chat-like interface
- Structured the system to easily extend with:
  - **Personalization and recommendation systems**
  - **Topic-wise progress tracking**
  - **Content recommendation for weak areas**
- Focused on **latency, reliability, and scalability**, enabling local inference rather than relying on remote APIs

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python (FastAPI / Flask), REST APIs  
- LLM: Local model (Ollama / GPT4All / similar)  
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML/CSS (or React, if used)
